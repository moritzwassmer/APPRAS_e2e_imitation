# End2Endappras



## Description

This repository was created for the course Applications of Robotics and Autonomous Systems at TU Berlin WS22/23. 
The project aims to create a End-to-End model for autonomous driving that is developed in the simulator Carla. 
Specifically, the project aims to investigate and compare the performance of several different sensor-setups. 
The set-ups investigated are the [following](https://gitlab.com/jakowiren/end2endappras/-/issues/18):

 - RGB
 - RGB + LiDAR
 - RGB + Radar
 - RGB + LiDAR + Radar


## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
