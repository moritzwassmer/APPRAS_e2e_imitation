# git Version Control

- [ ] [Documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/)



## Why use git?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.
